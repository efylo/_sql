# DELIMITER

## Abstract

**DELIMITER** is a character that divides between syntaxes. Syntax here in SQL represents the Query. 

**DELIMITER** in MySQL is in default semi-colon(;). In convention, creation of procedure or function is done after changing **DELIMITER** into double dollar-sign($$). 

If there is no change of **DELIMITER**, then queries inside the procedure is not interpreted as *a query* but rather can be interpreted as the end of the creation.
