# SQL

## Abstract

SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a language for manipulation upon database. Then, what is the main reason of using database? I don't really know, since I've not seen the whole process of the development of SW engineering. 

It is possible to find some files or executables in your personal computer even without enough organization. Though, I think it is really hard work to maintain the files or information of large number of people. The data should be considered careful enough so that the client or the one who requests it doesn't get frustrated. 

Thus, increasing demands upon dealing with the large amount of data results in the method called database and SQL. The database may contain the users' data, information, or anything else, and SQL is a language to manipulate the database. 

I, dreaming for back-end engineer, should consider studying for SQL since back-end would probably deal with multiple queries. Few queries may be understandable without further knowledge of SQL or database, though majority of those queries will demand the knowledge about the database.

## How?

Then, how can I study SQL?

1. Interpretation of the concepts of the database systems. 
   - Some representative examples will be helpful. 
   - e.g) Student administration system, Library system, etc. 
2. Choose the SQL language. 
   - Though S in SQL stands for Structured, 
   - many languages have their own specialized features, grammars, etc. 
3. Study the chosen SQL language through examples. 
   - There are many websites for me to learn through examples. 
   - Solving the examples will include searching the functions of SQL. 
   - e.g) programmers, hackerrank, and much more.

## My Choice

I chose MySQL for studying. MySQL is open-source and one of the most-used SQL language. Solving the examples by reading MySQL official Docs will be the method I choose to study.
