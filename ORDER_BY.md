# ORDER BY

## Abstract

Since Structured Query Language(SQL) deals with the table, there are certain situations that necessarily need sort. The sorting function is done through **ORDER BY** statement, and you can denote the attribute you want to order by. 

### Statements

- **ORDER BY A**: Order the table with respect to the attribute A in ascending(default) order
- **ORDER BY A DESC**: Order the table w.r.t the attribute A in descending order
- **ORDER BY A, B**: Order the table w.r.t the attribute A then B both in ascending order
